\section{Organization}

This project follows the Scrum framework. Meetings are performed in conformance with the Scrum ceremonies. Management software is used to facilitate Scrum and to track and plan progress. JIRA is the software of choice, containing the backlog, sprint backlog and burndown charts, as well as resources. Additionally, a project plan is generated as a Gantt-chart to ensure the project deadline is met. Project cycles are fixed-length iterations, referred to as Sprints which have planned endings and start every other Tuesday, starting February $17^{th}$ $2017$. Human resources are allocated in JIRA as each sprint is defined in the sprint planning meeting.
\\\\
We are also using ShareLaTex. LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents \cite{latex}. ShareLaTex is the version of the software that allows us to edit documents online. In order to have all of our documents saved at all times, we are pushing the documents to GitHub. 
\\\\
GitHub is a development platform inspired by the way you work. Host code, manage projects, and build software alongside millions of other developers. GitHub brings teams together to work through problems, move ideas forward, and learn from each other along the way \cite{github}. This way we know that all of our documents are always saved, in case of any unforeseen situations that can cause us to lose our documents. It also makes it easier to track the document history. 

\subsection{Work Hours}

The group has agreed that working hours are between 8:15 to 16:15, Tuesday to Friday. This gives a total of 32 planned work hours per person in one week. After Easter, the team will have one additional day, since exams are over. One day a week is a nonworking day, preferably Saturday. Sundays will be utilized if additional work days are required. 

\subsection{Meetings}
In the second week of a sprint, Tuesday from 10:00 to 11:00 the sprint retrospective meeting is held. The team discuss and evaluate the last sprint, and learn from mistakes and successes. The wisdom gained in the retrospective meeting is noted and considered in the Sprint Planning meeting.
\\\\
After the retrospective meeting, Sprint Planning meeting is held from 11:00 to 14:00. In this meeting, user-stories are given a relative time estimate called  story-points. Stories are divided into  tasks and chores that must be completed in order to achieve the sprint goal. The outcome is a product backlog with elaborated and estimated tasks. The team can take on any task or chore they see fit to work on. 
\\\\
We are also making a Spring Log after each Sprint. In the Sprint Log we are describing what we have done during this Sprint, what we were not able to do, why we were not able to do these tasks and what we could have done better. This will allow us to learn from each Sprint and do better the upcoming and following Sprints. 
\\\\
Scrum reviews are performed after a sprint is ended. The planned days for these meetings are Fridays. The attendees are the team, product owner, scrum master, internal and/or external supervisors. Product increments produced in the last sprint is presented and discussed, any necessary changes and re-prioritization are made.
\\\\
Once a day, the group performs a daily stand-up meeting of no more than 15 minutes. This meeting is referred to as "Daily Scrum" and starts 8:45 AM.
